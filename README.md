# SmartNest AI
*Cloud-based material optimization for small and medium-sized manufacturing companies*

### 1. The Problem

Small metalworking and woodworking shops lose thousands of dollars a year in **material waste**. Although high-end CNC software exists, it often:

* **Cost-Prohibitive:** Licenses can cost over $5,000 USD.
* **Hardware Dependent:** Requires powerful workstations and local installations.
* **Overly Complex:** Small shops only need to know how to fit 20 parts into 3 sheets quickly, without a 200-page manual.

As a result, many engineers still manually calculate layouts in Excel or CAD, leading to "scrap rates" as high as 20-30%.

### Why SmartNest AI is Better

SmartNest AI is a lightweight, browser-based **Nesting-as-a-Service (NaaS)** platform. It solves the problem better because:

* **Zero-Friction Access:** No installation required. Upload a DXF or input dimensions from a tablet right on the shop floor.
* **Proprietary Optimization Algorithm**: Automatically generates efficient cutting layouts using proven nesting strategies, reducing kerf waste and material costs in seconds.
* **Cost Transparency:** It doesn't just show a layout; it calculates the exact cost savings and carbon footprint reduction per job.
* **Niche Focus:** Designed specifically for the "Middle Market"—shops that are too big for manual guessing but too small for enterprise PLM software.
